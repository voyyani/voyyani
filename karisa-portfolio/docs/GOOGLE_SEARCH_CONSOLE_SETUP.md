**Current Domain**: `https://voyani.tech`

Ensure your site is:
- ✅ Live and accessible at https://voyani.tech

3. Click **"Add Property"**

### Step 3: Add Your Property

You have two options:

2. Enter: `https://voyani.tech`
3. Click **Continue**

### Step 4: Verify Ownership

Google offers several verification methods. Choose the easiest for your setup:

#### Method 1: HTML File Upload (Recommended for Vite)

1. Download the verification HTML file from Google
2. Place it in your `public/` folder:
   ```
   public/google1234567890abcdef.html
   ```
3. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy dist/ folder
   ```
4. Verify the file is accessible:
   ```

   ```jsx
   // src/components/SEO.jsx
   <Helmet>
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
     {/* ... existing meta tags ... */}
   </Helmet>
   ```
3. Deploy the update
4. Click **"Verify"** in GSC
